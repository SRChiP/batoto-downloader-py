batoto-downloader-py
====================

Python port of https://github.com/koroshiya/batoto-downloader
Uses wxpython: http://www.wxpython.org/download.php#stable
Based on python 2.7.3 and wxpython 2.8.12.1

This version of batoto-downloader is significantly faster and lighter than its Java equivalent.
All of the same features should be present, but in the future, only this version may be maintained.

As with the initial java project, batoto-downloader-py is used to store and parse chapter URLs from the website Batoto.net
URLs should be for individual chapters. You can simply copy and paste the link to a specific chapter.
