Example chapter URL: http://bato.to/read/_/272903/kingdom_v37_ch402_by_turnip-farmers<br>
<br>
The first example URL would create a folder called "kingdom-r642".<br>
It would then create individual folders inside there for each chapter.<br>
Each chapter folder would contain its own pages.<br>

The second example URL would create a folder called "kingdom_v37_ch402_by_turnip-farmers".<br>
All of the chapter's pages would be downloaded into that directory.<br>
